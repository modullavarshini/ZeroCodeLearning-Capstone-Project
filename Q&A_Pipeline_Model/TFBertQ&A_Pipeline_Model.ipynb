      "k nearest neighbors algorithm also known as KNN or k NN is a non parametric supervised learning classifier which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.The left panel has Advanced Options section where there is option to Set test sample percentage Use the toggle bar to set required percentage of test sample.The left panel has Advanced Options section where there is option to Select maximum nearest neighbours Use the toggle bar to set required number of nearest neighbours.The left panel has Advanced Options section where there is option to Select number of CV folds Use the toggle bar to set required number of Cross Validation CV folds. KNN results tab consists of model accuracy performance for different k values along with a graphical representation for ther same.Regression analysis is a way of mathematically sorting out which of those variables does indeed have an impact. A dependent variable is the main factor that you re trying to understand or predict. The independent variables are the factors you suspect have an impact on your dependent variable.Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics such as charts plots infographics and even animations to communicate complex data relationships and data driven insights.A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency of numerical data using rectangles to give a rough sense of the density of the underlying distribution of the data and often for density estimation estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. In a histogram the height of a rectangle the vertical axis represents the distribution frequency of a variable the amount or how often that variable appears . The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the x axis are all 1 then a histogram is identical to a relative frequency plot.A pair plot gives pairwise relationships in a dataset to understand the best set of features to explain a relationship between two variables or to form the most separated clusters. The pair plot function creates a grid of Axes such that each variable in data will be shared in the y axis across a single row and on the x axis across a single column.A Correlation Table is a two way tabulation of the relations between correlates row headings are the scores on one variable and column headings are the scores on the second variable and a cell shows how many times the score on that row was associated with the score in that column.A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables where each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables.The summary tab provides the overall analysis result under a few methods like OLS Ordinary Least Square RMSE Root Mean Square Error Variance Inflation Factor VIF etc.Ordinary Least Squares regression or OLS is a common technique for estimating coefficients of linear regression equations which describe the relationship between one or more independent quantitative variables and a dependent variable simple or multiple linear regression .Root Mean Square Error or RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals or it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. Residuals or errors are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are.Variance inflation factor or VIF is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables and for a regression model variable is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only that single independent variable. we can calculate the VIF for the variable points by performing a multiple linear regression using points as the response variable and assists and rebounds as the explanatory variables.R Squared or RÂ² or the coefficient of determination is a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable. In other words r squared shows how well the data fit the regression model.The correlation coefficient is a specific measure that quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between two variables in a correlation analysis. A correlation analysis provides information on the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables while a simple linear regression analysis estimates parameters in a linear equation that can be used to predict values of one variable based on the other.The Summary OLS tab evaluates the correlation coefficients between variables and represents them through a correlation map where each cell depicts a correlation between 2 variables and the size and color of the circles in each cell depict the degree of correlation the larger the size and darker the color shade the higher is the correlation.A residual plot has the residual values on the Y axis and the independent variable on the x axis.In regression analysis prediction error quantifies how well the model predicts the response variable and in classification it quantifies how well samples are classified to the correct category. Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups the goal of clustering is to find clusters within a data set.Cluster centriods is middle of a cluster A centroid is a vector that contains one number for each variable where each number is the mean of a variable for the observations in that cluster the centroid can be thought of as the multi dimensional average of the cluster and the centroids are calculated based on the Number of clusters.Principal component analysis PCA is an unsupervised machine learning technique the most popular use of principal component analysis is dimensionality reduction and Besides using PCA as a data preparation technique we can also use it to help visualize data A PCA plot shows clusters of samples based on their similarity. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation but also for general non linear dimension reduction and UMAP is an algorithm based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from topological data analysis further It provides a very general framework for approaching manifold learning and dimension reduction but can also provide specific concrete realizations.K means clustering is a method used for clustering analysis especially in data mining and statistics and It aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters k resulting in the partitioning of the data into Voronoi cells. Hierarchical clustering also known as hierarchical cluster analysis is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters and the endpoint is a set of clusters where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.k medoids is a classical partitioning technique of clustering that splits the data set of n objects into k clusters where the number k of clusters assumed known a priori which implies that the programmer must specify k before the execution of a k medoids algorithm. Spectral clustering is a technique with roots in Graph theory where the approach is used to identify communities of nodes in a graph based on the edges connecting them and the method is flexible and allows us to cluster non graph data as well. HDBSCAN is a clustering algorithm it extends DBSCAN by converting it into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and then using a technique to extract a flat clustering based in the stability of clusters. The left side of the screen left panel has an option of Input data Click on the Browse option and upload dataset in CSV format here.The Overview tab provides you with relevant study resources tutorials sample datasets and a short overview to start with which helps you understand and comprehend your data correctly.On the left panel there s an option called Data selection where you can select your favourable number of Y variables required to base the analysis Select and click on Apply Changes . The left panel has Advanced Options section where there is option of Select sub sample Click on the drop down option to select random number of observations for testing or the whole data itself. The left panel has Advanced Options section where there is option of Impute missing values or drop missing value rows Click on the drop down to select the option of dropping or imputing the missing values.The Data Summary tab enables you to get a comprehensive evaluation through statistical measures that help us form the basis of our analysis It will display all the descriptive analytics measures including minimum value maximum value range between data values mean median standard deviation variance etc. A decision tree is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label. A Class label is the model decision that is assigned after computing all attributes.Decision Trees or DTs are a non parametric supervised learning method used for both classification problems and prediction problems. Decision Tree or DT works by creating a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A decision tree makes decisions by splitting nodes into sub nodes. This process is performed multiple times during the training process until only homogenous nodes are left. And it is the only reason why a decision tree can perform so well. A decision tree makes decisions by splitting nodes into sub nodes. This process is performed multiple times during the training process until only homogenous nodes are left. Variable importance is determined by calculating the relative influence of each variable whether that variable was selected to split on during the tree building process and how much the squared error over all trees improved decreased as a result. Variable importance analysis provides the tools to assess the importance of input variables when dealing with complex interactions making the machine learning model more interpretable and computationally more efficient. A decision tree guides a user from an initial question into one of the multiple possible end states.We can zoom and click on the nodes to know the details regarding various aspects included in the analysis.This gives better description and detail oriented regarding paths and the node analysis also variable influence over the root to leaf i.e top to bottom order of decision tree. Binary logit Regression Binary logistic regression is a regression model where the target variable is binary that is it can take only two values 0 or 1.Logistic regression is easier to implement interpret and very efficient to train. If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features Logistic Regression should not be used otherwise it may lead to overfitting. It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. It is named Logistic Regression because its underlying technique is quite the same as Linear Regression. The term Logistic is taken from the Logit function that is used in this method of classification.Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions over total predictions accuracy correct predictions total predictions. This is how we can find the accuracy with logistic regression score LogisticRegression.score X test y test . The most basic diagnostic of a logistic regression is predictive accuracy.Not only does binary logistic regression allow you to assess how well yourset of variables predicts your categorical dependent variable and determine the goodness of fit of your model as does regular linear regression but also it provides a summary of the accuracy of the classification of cases.A confusion matrix of binary classification is a two by two table formed by counting of the number of the four outcomes of a binary classifier. We usually denote them as TP FP TN and FN instead of the number of true positives and so on. Predicted Theoretical probability uses math to predict the outcomes. Just divide the favorable outcomes by the possible outcomes. It gives information about errors made by the classifier and the types of errors that are being made. It reflects how a classification model is disorganized and confused while making predictions.The Area Under the ROC curve AUC is an aggregated metric that evaluates how well a logistic regression model classifies positive and Negative outcomes at all possible cutoffs. It can range from 0.5 to 1 and the larger it is the better.ROC curves in logistic regression are used for determining the best cutoff value for predicting whether a new observation is a failure 0 or asuccess 1 The ROC curve shows the trade off between sensitivity or TPR and specificity 1 â FPR . Classifiers that give curves closer to the top left corner indicate a better performance. As a baseline a random classifier is expected to give points lying along the diagonal FPR TPR .The Summary logit tab evaluates the correlation coefficients between variables and represents them through a correlation map where each cell depicts a correlation between 2 variables and the size and color of the circles in each cell depict the degree of correlation the larger the size and darker the color shade the higher is the correlation. Regression analysis is a way of mathematically sorting out which of those variables does indeed have an impact. A dependent variable is the main factor that you re trying to understand or predict.
